The repository includes the corresponding solvers—stationary_PSS_BM, nonstationary_PSS_BM, and a simulated annealing benchmark—as well as the problem instances used in our study, including TSP datasets from TSPLIB. All parameter settings in the code are consistent with those reported in the paper. Users are encouraged to modify the code for further testing; please ensure that input and output file paths are updated accordingly for proper execution.
